# Homelab Deployment

This is a set of playbooks and terraform modules to build out my kubernetes homelab from scratch. This started out with a mess of very basic shell scripts running terraform and kubectl commands. Variables were not broken out either. This will be the end result of cleaning everything up and splitting variables and secrets out properly. Once the base level is set, I will begin migrating over other workloads into this with the end goal of moving most of my homelab into kubernetes.
